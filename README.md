# Market Analysis Report for National Clothing Chain

An online national clothing chain needs your help creating a targeted marketing campaign. Sales have been flat and they want to lure lost customers back. They want to advertise specific products to specific customers in specific locations, but they donâ€™t know who to target. They have three products in mind:  
Shirt: $25  
Sweater: $100  
Leather Bag: $1,000  
They need you to conduct an analysis to determine the best product to advertise to each customer.
